# Matrix Multiplication with PyTest and GitHub Actions/Issues

## What is this repo?
The purpose of this repo was to experiment with the functionality of GitHub Actions and Issues, as well as utilize pytest to confirm the functionality of a simple matrix multiplication script.

## How it works
Currently, the repo is configured to check the test cases stated in "test_matrix_mult.py" whenever a push is made to the repo. Correctness can be checked in the "Actions" tab of this repo. Past attempts showcasing incorrect environment set-up, incorrect test cases, and unused areas of code can be found in this tab as well. 

A test issue was also generated by me and resolved by me to practice using the functionality.

### How to run the matrix multiplication
If you want to utilize the matrix multiplication function, import the matrix_multiply function from the matrix_mult.py file and call the function.   

## What was learned?
Overall this exercise worked as an effective teaching tool to familiarize myself with some of the functionality of a repo beyond just version control.

# Dockerized Version
This project comes with a Dockerfile that allows users to easily download and run the project.

To prepare it, within the directory that the Dockerfile is in fun the following commands:

docker run python-imagename

docker run -it python-imagename

(-it allows for terminal interaction)
